I had the chance to hear Francois Chollet's talk at AGI-2024, and a brief chance to meet him later.
He described the ARC-AGI set of problems which are almost trivial for humans to solve, but some of the most advanced AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, etc) get very poor scores on these problems.
Obviously this goes to the core of the cognitive processes in the human brain versus deep learning/generative algorithms running much of the AI systems around us.

His talk is on YouTube:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL9jEy99Nh0
